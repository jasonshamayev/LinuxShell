This code is written in "standard C, and has been testing on a Unix VM
It uses system() function
Added many different operations, like Remove, Move, and Rename 
Sorting does NOT work, but all the byte sizes and dates last modified ARE available and in a struct
they just need to be printed out, i have commented a code for both of them to print (currently commented out)
Byte size and Date last modified are working properly and work in the struct with numerous testing
